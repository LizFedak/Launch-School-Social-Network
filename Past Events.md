Hi everyone! We're going to be hosting another TWO events on Thursday as we continue our beta mode. The first meetup was a lot of fun and it was great to meet new people from Launch School in a more social format.
From the feedback we gathered, having 10 attendees seemed like too many people, so we'll be limiting each event to 8 attendees this week to see if that's a more comfortable number.
We are adding a 'ground rule' and some more structure:
Don't assume prior knowledge. What does that mean? If you are sharing about an experience you had or topic you're knowledgeable on, share a small summary of what it is so everyone can follow along with the conversation and ask questions.
Structurally, we'll start with a fun ice breaker and open up a channel with attendees a bit earlier so we can introduce ourselves, get organized, etc.
Thursday, Nov 5, 10:30 AM - 11:30 AM ET (Hosted by Liz) - Format will be voted on
Thursday, Nov 5, 1 PM - 2 PM ET (Hosted by Leena) - Topic is "Mindful Study Practice"
To RSVP, please respond to the appropriate thread below this message. We'll have a waitlist for both events. Please let us know 1 day ahead of time if you need to cancel your RSVP so we can fill the spot from the waitlist!
