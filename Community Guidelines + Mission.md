# Mission Statement
Connect with Launch School students globally via online social meetups.

## Introduction to #the_social_network
Curious to get to know other Launch School students, without the code? We are all studying and working together, let's also have fun together!

We started these social meetups to make it easy to meet fellow students in a relaxed, social, (and physically distant) setting, and everyone is welcome to join and contribute. 

Let us know if you want to get involved with leading a session or have ideas for social meetups. Standard [LS Code of Conduct](https://launchschool.com/code_of_conduct) and [Community Guidelines](https://launchschool.com/community_guidelines) apply for all meetups and are very important towards making these fun and safe for all!
