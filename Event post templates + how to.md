See [here](https://github.com/LizFedak/Launch-School-Social-Network/blob/main/Past%20Events.md) for previous event messages.

## General Template
- Title
- Catchy description, bonus points if you add a touch of humour
- Tech needed
- Date, Time, Limit (if capping participants)
- Optional: Waitlist Info (usually if the limit of participants has been reached, just EDIT the post)

## Tip
The goal of these events is to meet students whom you may not have the chance too (ex: students from the other track, studying at a different pace, potentially staff...). Make it inclusive and welcome to all. Some of us have full-time jobs and families, but still want to socialize. These events are meant to offer an alternative to the regular coding talk and focus on being humans, having fun, getting to know each other, and maybe playing games!
