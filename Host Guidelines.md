# Why host an event at #the_social_network ?
1. Get to know other students that are going through the curriculum in a laid back athmosphere
2. Hear from students from both tracks and at different levels
3. Build friendships with your peers beyond programming 
4. Have a good laugh, insighful discussion and show off your uniqueness in a safe space :) 

# Interested in hosting an event ? 
First thing first, make sure you read, understand and accept the [Guidelines & Mission](https://github.com/LizFedak/Launch-School-Social-Network/blob/main/Community%20Guidelines%20+%20Mission.md). 
This is mandatory and the only rules you have to follow. You will be hosting on Launch School ground after all and you need to know what is accepted and what's not.

Second, determine the goal of the event you'd like to host. 
Some ideas include: 
- Meeting others in a relaxed setting for informal conversation
- Structured meetup around a topic you're enthusiastic about 
- Playing a game with students for fun
- Demographic related (parents/full-time workers/others) topic

Third, logisitcs.
- You'll need to know the max amount of participants you want. If you are a solo host, 8 is a good number to allow everyone to talk.
- When are you holding this event ? Pick a date or poll #the_social_network to see when works best for most.
- For how long ? Most events are an hour long. The important thing is to let people know ahead of time. 
- What is the agenda going to be ? Intro, game, conversation ? Have a basic outline in case conversation dies out. 
- Where? Will you use Zoom, Meet or something else ? Inform participants of tech requirements ahead of time. 
- People. Do you want to give priority to new students or first come first served ? 

Fouth, publicize:
- On #the_social_network at the very least. 
- Other places of interest include: #general, #student_lounge, #the-spot, the forum 

Fith, track sign ups and student questions, remind participants of the meetup details, and host! 
- One thing we've noticed that works well is having all the confirmed participants in a Slack Message or a Slack Channel.
